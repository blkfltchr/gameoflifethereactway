          According to Bitstorm, "This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970. It consists of a collection of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game."

            <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
